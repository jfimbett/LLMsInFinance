## Course Structure

This course is organized by days, with each day consisting of:
- Lecture materials
- Practical sessions

### Days Overview

- **Day 0**: Course Introduction
- **Day 1**: Getting Started with LLMs
  - Environment setup
  - Version control
  - HuggingFace

4. API keys for LLM services (OpenAI/DeepSeek)

See each practical session's README for specific setup instructions.

## Preliminaries

If you're new to Python or need a refresher on the fundamentals needed for this course, check out the [Preliminaries](src/preliminaries/README.md) section, which includes:

- A comprehensive [Python Crash Course](src/preliminaries/01-python-crash-course.ipynb) with NumPy and PyTorch
- Introduction to vectors and tensors for neural networks
- Basic neural network concepts for understanding LLMs

This material will help you get up to speed before diving into the main course content.

## Day 1 Practical Session

The Day 1 practical session now includes comprehensive Jupyter notebooks covering:
- Python environment setup
- Git and version control
