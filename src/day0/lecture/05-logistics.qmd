## Why should we care about LLMs?

- **How is AI shaping labor markets?**
  - Economists do not only use AI as a tool in their projects, they also study how AI is changing the economy.
  - Consider a broader definition of a job, which includes different tasks that aggregate in the job description. 
      - E.g. a job as a data scientist can include tasks such as data cleaning, data analysis, model building, and model deployment.
      - Private Equity analysts need to search for deals, analyze documents, pitch to clients, and negotiate terms.
  - AI will automate some of these tasks, but not all of them. Your value will come from being more efficient at the tasks that AI cannot do.
