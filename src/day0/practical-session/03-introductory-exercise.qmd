## Introductory Exercise: Your First LLM Call

### Objective
Test your environment and make your first API call to understand what we'll be working with.

### Exercise 1: Simple API Test
Create a new Jupyter notebook `day0_intro.ipynb`:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import openai

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))

# Simple completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain what a stock is in simple terms."}
    ],
    max_tokens=100
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Exercise 2: Finance-Specific Prompt
Try this financial analysis prompt:

```python
financial_prompt = """
Analyze the following financial statement excerpt:
'Revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $2.3B, while operating expenses grew 8% to $1.8B.'

Provide a brief analysis of the company's performance.
"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": financial_prompt}],
    max_tokens=150
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Exercise 3: Reflect
- What surprised you about the LLM's responses?
- How might this be useful in finance?
- What concerns do you have?
