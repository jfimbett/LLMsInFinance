# Word Embeddings in Finance

## What Are Word Embeddings?

### Technical Definition
- **Word embeddings**: Dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space
- Words are mapped to real-valued vectors in an n-dimensional space (typically 100-300 dimensions)
- Semantically similar words are positioned closer together in this vector space
- The relative positions and distances between word vectors encode meaningful relationships

### Intuition
- Think of embeddings as "translating" words into a language that computers understand (numbers)
- Each dimension represents a latent feature of the word's meaning
- Instead of treating words as isolated symbols, embeddings capture their context and relationships
- Example: In a 2D simplification, "profit" and "earnings" would be close together, while "loss" would be farther away

## Why Embeddings Matter in Finance

- Transform unstructured textual data (news, reports, filings) into structured numerical data
- Enable quantitative analysis of qualitative information
- Allow algorithms to understand semantic relationships between financial concepts
- Support tasks like sentiment analysis, document classification, and information retrieval
- Bridge the gap between natural language and mathematical models

## Traditional Word Embedding Methods

### Count-Based Methods

#### Bag of Words (BoW)
- Represents text as occurrence counts of words
- Simple but loses word order and context
- Financial application: Basic frequency analysis of terms in earnings reports

#### TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- Weights word importance by frequency in document and rarity across corpus
- Helps identify distinctive terms in financial documents
- Financial application: Identifying unusual language in disclosures

#### Co-occurrence Matrices
- Counts how often words appear together in context windows
- Can capture some semantic relationships
- Financial application: Analyzing relationships between economic terms

### Prediction-Based Methods

#### Word2Vec
- **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)**: Predicts target word from surrounding context
- **Skip-gram**: Predicts surrounding context from target word
- Captures semantic and syntactic word relationships
- Financial application: Analyzing relationships between market terms

#### GloVe (Global Vectors)
- Combines count-based and prediction-based approaches
- Factorizes global word co-occurrence matrix
- Preserves linear substructures of word vector space
- Financial application: Identifying related financial concepts

#### FastText
- Extension of Word2Vec that uses character n-grams
- Better handles rare words and morphologically rich languages
- Can represent out-of-vocabulary words
- Financial application: Processing specialized financial terminology

## Properties of Word Vector Spaces

### Semantic Clustering
- Words with similar meanings cluster together
- Example: "equity," "stock," "share" form a cluster

### Vector Arithmetic
- Word vectors can be added and subtracted with meaningful results
- Classical example: "king" - "man" + "woman" ≈ "queen"
- Financial examples:
  - "Bull" - "Market" + "Housing" ≈ "Bubble"
  - "Fed" + "Increase" ≈ "Rates"
  - "Bond" - "Price" + "Increase" ≈ "Yield"

### Analogical Reasoning
- Vector relationships encode semantic relationships
- Enables solving analogies: A:B :: C:D
- Financial example: "Stock:Equity :: Bond:Debt"

## Finance-Specific Word Embeddings

### Domain Adaptation
- Generic embeddings often miss nuances in financial language
- Domain-specific embeddings are trained on financial corpora:
  - Earnings call transcripts
  - Financial news
  - SEC filings
  - Analyst reports

### Benefits in Financial Applications
- More accurate representation of financial terminology
- Better capture of relationships between market concepts
- Improved performance in financial NLP tasks:
  - Sentiment analysis of market news
  - Classification of financial documents
  - Information extraction from reports

## Limitations of Traditional Embeddings

### Context Insensitivity
- Each word has only one vector regardless of context
- Polysemy problem: "bank" (financial institution vs. river edge)
- "Interest" (monetary vs. attentional) has different meanings in finance

### Static Nature
- Cannot adapt to evolving language and new terminology
- Market-specific terms change meaning during different economic cycles

### Rare Terms Challenge
- Financial jargon and specialized terminology often lack quality embeddings
- Numerical values and symbols are not well represented

### Phrase Handling
- Important financial phrases ("interest rate," "balance sheet") need special treatment
- Individual word embeddings may not capture phrase meanings
