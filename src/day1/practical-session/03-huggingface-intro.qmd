# Introduction to HuggingFace

## What is HuggingFace?

HuggingFace is an AI community and platform that provides:
- Pre-trained models for various NLP tasks
- Datasets for training and fine-tuning
- Tools for model development and deployment
- A collaborative ecosystem for sharing models

## Key Libraries

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Transformers**: Access to pre-trained models
- **Datasets**: Data loading and processing
- **Tokenizers**: Text preprocessing
- **Accelerate**: Distributed training
- **Evaluate**: Model evaluation
:::

```{python}
#| eval: false
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
from datasets import load_dataset
import evaluate

# Basic imports cover most use cases
```

## Exploring the Model Hub

The [HuggingFace Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) hosts thousands of pre-trained models:

```{python}
#| eval: false
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

# Load a financial sentiment analysis model
model_name = "ProsusAI/finbert"
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Use the model
text = "The company reported strong earnings this quarter."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
```

## Financial Models on HuggingFace

- **FinBERT**: Financial sentiment analysis
- **BloombergGPT**: Financial text generation
- **FinGPT**: Open-source financial LLM
- **Finance-RoBERTa**: Financial document classification

## Exercise: Exploring Model Hub

1. Visit [huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models)
2. Search for "finance" or "financial" 
3. Examine the model cards to understand:
   - Training data
   - Model architecture
   - Performance metrics
   - Use cases
