# Introduction to the Practical Session

Welcome to the hands-on component of Day 1! In this session, we'll set up our working environment and start interacting with Large Language Models.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up a Python environment suitable for LLM applications
- Learn basic version control practices with Git
- Explore the HuggingFace ecosystem
- Access and interact with LLMs through APIs

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- A GitHub account (for version control)
- An internet connection

## Jupyter Notebooks

For this practical session, we'll be working with Jupyter notebooks. You can find the notebooks in the `practical-session` folder:

1. [Environment Setup](01-environment-setup.ipynb) - Setting up your Python environment for LLM development
2. [Git and Version Control](02-git-version-control.ipynb) - Basic version control practices for LLM projects
3. [HuggingFace Setup](03-huggingface-setup.ipynb) - Using models locally with HuggingFace
4. [LLM APIs](04-llm-apis.ipynb) - Accessing LLMs through OpenAI and DeepSeek APIs

## Wrap Up

By completing this practical session, you've laid the foundation for working with LLMs in finance. In Day 2, we'll build on these skills to develop more advanced applications.
