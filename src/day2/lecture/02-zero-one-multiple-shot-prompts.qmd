volatility relative to the 
overall market. A beta of 1 
means the stock moves with 
the market. Higher beta

To calculate the DCF valuation:

1) First, project cash flows 
   for 5 years
2) Determine terminal value 
   using growth rate g
3) Calculate WACC
4) Discount all cash flows 
   to present value
5) Sum the results to get 
   enterprise value
6) Adjust for debt and cash
