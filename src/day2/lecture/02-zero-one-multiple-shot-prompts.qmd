## Zero-Shot Prompting

- Model responds without examples
- Example: "Explain the Efficient Market Hypothesis"
- Benefits: Simplicity and directness
- Limitations: Less control over output format and style
- Financial applications: Quick market insights, basic definitions

## One-Shot Prompting

- Providing a single example before the query
- Example: "Q: What is CAPM? A: Capital Asset Pricing Model is... Now, what is Arbitrage Pricing Theory?"
- Improved response structure and consistency
- Particularly useful for standardized financial analyses
- Applications: Financial report generation, consistent risk assessments

## Few-Shot Prompting

- Multiple examples establish clear patterns
- Helps LLMs understand specific formats and requirements
- Extremely effective for specialized financial tasks
- Example: Multiple financial ratio calculations before asking for a new one
- Applications: Complex financial modeling, specialized report generation

## Advanced Prompting Techniques for Finance
