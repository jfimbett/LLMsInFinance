## Chain-of-Thought Prompting

- Explicitly asking models to "think step by step"
- Dramatic improvement in complex financial calculations
- Example: "Walk through the calculation of a company's free cash flow"
- Enables verification of intermediary steps
- Reduces mathematical errors in financial analyses

## Tree of Thoughts

- Exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously
- Evaluating different analytical approaches
- Critical for risk assessment and scenario analysis
- Applications: Portfolio optimization, investment strategy evaluation
- Enhanced decision-making in uncertain market conditions

## Self-Consistency & Verification

- Generating multiple solutions to the same problem
- Identifying inconsistencies in financial reasoning
- Cross-checking numerical results and conclusions
- Improved accuracy for high-stakes financial decisions
- Essential for regulatory compliance and audit trails

## Practical Applications in Finance

- Financial statement analysis with visible reasoning
- M&A valuation with transparent methodology
- Credit risk assessment with clear decision rationale
- Trading strategy development with explicit assumptions
- Regulatory reporting with traceable conclusions
