Mathematical equation solving:

Quadratic: ax² + bx + c = 0
Solution: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a
Example: x² - 5x + 6 = 0
Result: x = 2 or x = 3

Linear: ax + b = 0
Solution: x = -b/a
Example: 3x - 9 = 0
Result: x = 3

Exponential: aˣ = b
Solution: x = log_a(b)
Example: 2ˣ = 8
Result: x = 3

Logarithmic: log_a(x) = b
