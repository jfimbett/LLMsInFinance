I'll calculate the optimal solution step by step:

1. Known variable A = 25
2. Known variable B = 15
3. Ratio C = A/B = 1.67
4. Weight factor D = 70%
5. Result = A(D) + B(1-D)
   = 25(0.7) + 15(0.3)
   = 22
```

```
Let me determine if this system is 
balanced:

1. Identify the system components:
   - 5 input nodes
   - 4% error rate
   - Redundancy factor of 2

2. Calculate overall reliability:
   ...
