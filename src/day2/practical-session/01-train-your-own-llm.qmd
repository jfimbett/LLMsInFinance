## Preparing Financial Datasets

- Sources of financial data for fine-tuning
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Creating instruction-following datasets
- Handling sensitive financial information
- Balancing different financial domains and tasks

## Fine-tuning Techniques

- Full fine-tuning vs. parameter-efficient methods
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for resource efficiency
- QLoRA for even more efficient fine-tuning
- Hyperparameter selection for financial models
- Evaluating model performance improvements

## Hands-on Lab: Fine-tuning with Financial Text

- Setting up a fine-tuning environment
- Using Hugging Face's Trainer API
- Fine-tuning for financial sentiment analysis
- Monitoring training progress and avoiding overfitting
- Evaluating the fine-tuned model

## Deploying Your Fine-tuned Model

- Model quantization for efficiency
- Deployment options (local, cloud, API services)
- Model versioning and updating strategies
- Monitoring model performance in production
- Integrating with financial applications
