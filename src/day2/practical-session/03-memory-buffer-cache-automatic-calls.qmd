## Memory Types for Financial Applications

- Conversation buffer memory for client interactions
- Summary memory for long financial discussions
- Vector stores for retrieving relevant financial knowledge
- Entity memory for tracking financial instruments/companies
- Episodic memory for recurring client interactions

## Caching Strategies

- Token-level caching for efficiency
- Semantic caching for similar financial queries
- Cache invalidation strategies for time-sensitive data
- Balancing freshness and performance
- Compliance considerations for cached financial data

## Automatic Function Calling

- Tool use in modern LLMs
- Connecting models to financial APIs
- Parameter extraction from natural language
- Function calling for market data retrieval
- Structured output for financial systems integration
