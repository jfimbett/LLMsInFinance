# Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

## What is Prompt Engineering?

- The practice of designing and optimizing inputs to LLMs
- Systematically crafting prompts to achieve desired outputs
- A core skill for effective LLM application development

## Key Components of Effective Prompts

- **Clarity**: Explicit instructions and well-defined tasks
- **Context**: Relevant background information
- **Format**: Structured input with clear expectations
- **Examples**: Demonstrations of desired outputs (few-shot learning)
- **Constraints**: Boundaries and limitations for the model

## Prompt Types and Strategies

- **Zero-shot**: Direct instructions without examples
- **Few-shot**: Including examples of desired inputs and outputs
- **Chain-of-thought**: Guiding the model through reasoning steps
- **Self-consistency**: Multiple paths to validate outputs
- **System prompts**: Setting the model's persona and behavior
