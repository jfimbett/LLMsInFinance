## Valuation Fundamentals: DCF Foundation & Challenges

**The Core DCF Formula:**

$$\text{Enterprise Value} = \sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{\text{FCFF}_t}{(1+WACC)^t} + \frac{\text{TV}_T}{(1+WACC)^T}$$

**From EBIT to Free Cash Flow:**

$$FCFF_t = EBIT_t(1-\tau) + D\&A_t - CapEx_t - \Delta NWC_t$$

Where:
- $FCFF_t$ = Free Cash Flow to the Firm in period $t$
- $WACC$ = Weighted Average Cost of Capital  
- $TV_T$ = Terminal Value at forecast end
- $\tau$ = tax rate, $D\&A$ = depreciation & amortization

**DCF Challenges:**
- Requires detailed forecasts for 5-10 years
- Terminal value often represents 60-80% of total value  
- Highly sensitive to growth and discount rate assumptions
- Time-intensive and subjective

**Why Multiples Matter:**
- Quick market-based alternative
- Reflects current investor sentiment  
- Useful for cross-sectional comparison
- Can validate DCF assumptions

## The Mathematical Connection: DCF to Multiples (Part 1)

**Step 1: Start with the perpetuity DCF formula**

For a company in steady state with constant growth $g$:

$$EV = \frac{FCFF_1}{WACC - g}$$

**Step 2: Express FCFF in terms of EBITDA**

Starting from our FCFF formula:
$$FCFF = EBIT(1-\tau) + D\&A - CapEx - \Delta NWC$$

Since $EBIT = EBITDA - D\&A$, we can substitute:
$$FCFF = (EBITDA - D\&A)(1-\tau) + D\&A - CapEx - \Delta NWC$$

Expanding and simplifying:
$$FCFF = EBITDA(1-\tau) - D\&A(1-\tau) + D\&A - CapEx - \Delta NWC$$
$$FCFF = EBITDA(1-\tau) + D\&A \cdot \tau - CapEx - \Delta NWC$$

## The Mathematical Connection: DCF to Multiples (Part 2)

**Step 3: Express each component as a ratio of EBITDA**

Let's define these key ratios:
- $\kappa = \frac{CapEx}{EBITDA}$ (CapEx intensity)
- $\delta = \frac{D\&A}{EBITDA}$ (D&A rate) 
- $\omega = \frac{\Delta NWC}{EBITDA}$ (Working capital intensity)

**Step 4: Substitute back into the perpetuity formula**

$$FCFF = EBITDA[(1-\tau) + \delta \cdot \tau - \kappa - \omega]$$

Therefore:
$$EV = \frac{EBITDA[(1-\tau) + \delta \cdot \tau - \kappa - \omega]}{WACC - g}$$

**Step 5: Solve for the EV/EBITDA multiple**

$$\frac{EV}{EBITDA} = \frac{(1-\tau) + \delta \cdot \tau - \kappa - \omega}{WACC - g}$$

**Key Insight:** The EV/EBITDA multiple depends on tax rate, CapEx intensity, growth, and risk!

## Practical Example & Sensitivity Analysis

**Given company assumptions:**
- Tax rate: $\tau = 25\%$
- CapEx intensity: $\kappa = 15\%$ of EBITDA
- D&A rate: $\delta = 12\%$ of EBITDA  
- Working capital: $\omega = 2\%$ of EBITDA
- Growth rate: $g = 3\%$, WACC: $10\%$

**Step-by-step calculation:**

$$\frac{EV}{EBITDA} = \frac{(1-0.25) + (0.12 \times 0.25) - 0.15 - 0.02}{0.10 - 0.03}$$

$$= \frac{0.75 + 0.03 - 0.15 - 0.02}{0.07} = \frac{0.61}{0.07} = 8.7x$$

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
- If growth increases to 4%: Multiple = $\frac{0.61}{0.06} = 10.2x$
- If CapEx drops to 10%: Multiple = $\frac{0.66}{0.07} = 9.4x$
- If WACC rises to 12%: Multiple = $\frac{0.61}{0.09} = 6.8x$

**Key Takeaway:** Multiples ARE DCF models in disguise!
