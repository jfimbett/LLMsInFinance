# Forecasting with LLMs

## Beyond Traditional Forecasting

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Conventional forecasting relies on:
  - Historical data extrapolation
  - Analyst judgment
  - Statistical models (ARIMA, regression)
  - Expert consensus
- LLMs offer complementary capabilities:
  - Text + numerical data integration
  - Contextual understanding
  - Pattern recognition across domains
  - Synthesizing diverse information sources
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- **Key advantages**:
  - Multi-modal data processing
  - Dynamic context adaptation
  - Real-time information synthesis
  - Cross-domain pattern transfer

## The Look-Ahead Bias Challenge

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Definition**: Using future information not available at forecast time
- **Critical issue with LLMs**:
  - Training data includes past events presented as historical facts
  - Model may "know" outcomes that weren't available at decision point
- **Manifestations**:
  - "Predicting" known past events
  - Incorporating market reactions that followed events
  - Referencing subsequent strategic shifts
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- **Mitigation strategies**:
  - Explicit temporal context setting
  - Point-in-time data retrieval
  - Vintage database access
  - Prompt engineering with time constraints
  - Validation against contemporary forecasts
  - Critical evaluation of predictions

## Example: Time-Aware Prompting

```
CONTEXT: Today is June 10, 2022. You are a financial analyst 
preparing revenue forecasts for Tesla (TSLA).

USE ONLY INFORMATION AVAILABLE BEFORE THIS DATE.
DO NOT reference events, product launches, or financial 
results that occurred after June 10, 2022.

Based on Tesla's historical performance, industry trends, and 
currently announced plans, forecast quarterly revenue for 
Q3 and Q4 2022, explaining your methodology and key 
assumptions.
```

## Vintage-Based Approaches

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Point-in-time databases**:
  - Financial data as it was reported (before restatements)
  - Historical analyst estimates
  - News archives with publication dates
  
- **Temporal scaffolding**:
  - Structuring prompts with explicit timeframes
  - "As of [specific date]" framing
  - Limiting knowledge context
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- **Implementation techniques**:
  - Retrieval systems with temporal filters
  - Date-stamped document collections
  - Version-controlled financial databases
  - News archives with original publication dates
  - Historical market data snapshots

## Weighting Methodologies

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Source reliability weighting**:
  - Credibility assessment
  - Track record evaluation
  - Expertise-based weighting
  
- **Temporal proximity weighting**:
  - Recent information weighted higher
  - Decay functions for older data
  - Event-triggered reweighting
  
- **Consensus vs. outlier handling**:
  - Aggregation methodologies
  - Outlier detection and treatment
  - Minority view incorporation
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Weighted Forecast Ensemble Approach:**

- **Input Sources**: Multiple forecast inputs from different data types
- **Weighting Scheme**: Assign reliability scores based on:
  - Historical accuracy of each source
  - Relevance to current market conditions  
  - Data freshness and quality
- **Ensemble Calculation**: 
  - Final forecast = Σ(source_i × weight_i)
- **Confidence Estimation**:
  - Higher dispersion among sources → Lower confidence
  - Agreement among sources → Higher confidence
  - Adjust final confidence based on source reliability
