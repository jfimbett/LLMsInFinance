## Beyond Base Case Forecasting

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Single forecasts fail to capture uncertainty
- Scenario analysis explores multiple potential futures
- Traditional approach:
  - Base, upside, downside cases
  - Limited by human imagination and resources
- LLMs enable:
  - Broader scenario generation
  - Systematic variation of inputs
  - Creative yet plausible alternative futures
  - Internally consistent scenario narratives

## Scenario Generation Techniques

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Divergent thinking prompts**:
  - "Generate five distinct future scenarios for industry X"
  - "What unexpected developments could impact this sector?"
  
- **Structured variation**:
  - Systematically varying key parameters
  - "Generate a scenario where variable X is 20% higher"
  
- **Constraint-based scenarios**:
  - "Create a scenario constrained by factors A, B, and C"
  - Boundary exploration

Generate three distinct but plausible 
scenarios for Tesla's business 
environment in 2025:

1. A BASE CASE scenario reflecting 
   consensus expectations
   
2. An UPSIDE CASE incorporating 
   positive but reasonable 
   developments
   
3. A DOWNSIDE CASE reflecting 
   significant but plausible 
   challenges

For each scenario, provide:
- Key assumptions
- Market conditions
- Competitive landscape
- Regulatory environment
- Technology development path

## Cross-Impact Analysis

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Relationships between variables in complex systems
- Traditional challenge: manually mapping interactions
- LLM approach:
  - Identifying relationships between variables
  - Assessing mutual influences
  - Maintaining consistency across projections
  - Avoiding contradictory assumptions
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Cross-Impact Analysis Framework:**

- **Variable Relationships**: Map how scenario variables influence each other
- **Impact Assessment Methods**:
  - Historical correlation analysis
  - Expert judgment integration
  - LLM-based relationship evaluation
  - Economic theory validation
- **Matrix Construction**:
  - Each cell represents influence strength
  - Quantified impact scores (-1 to +1)
  - Asymmetric relationships captured
- **Applications**:
  - Scenario consistency checking
  - Propagation effect modeling
  - Feedback loop identification

## Monte Carlo Integration

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Moving beyond discrete scenarios to probability distributions
- LLMs can help with:
  - Parameter distribution definition
  - Correlation structure identification
  - Realistic constraint setting
  - Output interpretation
  
- Implementation approaches:
  - LLM-guided Monte Carlo simulation
  - Narrative interpretation of statistical results
  - Identifying key drivers of uncertainty
  - Tail risk articulation
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**LLM-Guided Monte Carlo Process:**

- **Input Variables**: Define probability distributions for key drivers
- **Correlation Matrix**: Capture relationships between variables
- **Simulation Steps**:
  1. Generate correlated random samples
  2. Calculate outcomes for each scenario
  3. Aggregate statistical results
  4. LLM interprets patterns and outliers
- **Narrative Output**:
  - Statistical summary with business interpretation
  - Key risk drivers identification
  - Tail event characterization
  - Actionable insights generation

## Narrative Scenario Construction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- LLMs excel at creating coherent narratives
- Benefits of narrative scenarios:
  - Engaging for stakeholders
  - Easier to comprehend than pure numbers
  - Captures qualitative factors
  - Provides context for quantitative projections
  
- Process:
  1. Generate narrative skeleton
  2. Develop quantitative implications
  3. Ensure internal consistency
  4. Link to financial projections

**Example Scenario Narrative:**

*"By 2026, the electric vehicle market has reached a tipping point with 37% market share in major markets. Tesla has maintained leadership with 28% EV market share despite intensified competition from legacy automakers and new entrants. Their energy business has grown to represent 15% of revenue as grid-scale storage adoption accelerated following policy shifts in key markets. Manufacturing efficiency improvements have lifted gross margins to 27% despite pricing pressure in the mid-range segment..."*
