# Scenario Analysis with LLMs

## Beyond Base Case Forecasting

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Single forecasts fail to capture uncertainty
- Scenario analysis explores multiple potential futures
- Traditional approach:
  - Base, upside, downside cases
  - Limited by human imagination and resources
- LLMs enable:
  - Broader scenario generation
  - Systematic variation of inputs
  - Creative yet plausible alternative futures
  - Internally consistent scenario narratives

## Scenario Generation Techniques

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Divergent thinking prompts**:
  - "Generate five distinct future scenarios for industry X"
  - "What unexpected developments could impact this sector?"
  
- **Structured variation**:
  - Systematically varying key parameters

- **Constraint-based scenarios**:
  - "Create a scenario constrained by factors A, B, and C"
  - Boundary exploration

Generate three distinct but plausible 
scenarios for Tesla's business 
environment in 2025:

1. A BASE CASE scenario reflecting 
   consensus expectations
   
2. An UPSIDE CASE incorporating 
   positive but reasonable 
   developments
   
3. A DOWNSIDE CASE reflecting 
   significant but plausible 
   challenges

For each scenario, provide:
- Key assumptions
- Market conditions
- Competitive landscape
- Regulatory environment
- Technology development path
```

## Cross-Impact Analysis

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Relationships between variables in complex systems
- Traditional challenge: manually mapping interactions
- LLM approach:
  - Identifying relationships between variables
  - Assessing mutual influences
  - Maintaining consistency across projections
  - Avoiding contradictory assumptions
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```python
def cross_impact_matrix(variables):
    """
    Generate cross-impact matrix for scenario
    
    Parameters:
    variables - Key scenario variables
    
    Returns:
    Matrix of impact relationships and strengths
    """
    matrix = {}
    
    for v1 in variables:
        matrix[v1] = {}
        for v2 in variables:
            if v1 != v2:
                # LLM assessment of relationship
                impact = assess_impact(v1, v2)
                matrix[v1][v2] = impact
    
    return matrix

## Monte Carlo Integration

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Moving beyond discrete scenarios to probability distributions
- LLMs can help with:
  - Parameter distribution definition
  - Correlation structure identification
  - Realistic constraint setting
  - Output interpretation
  
- Implementation approaches:
  - LLM-guided Monte Carlo simulation
  - Narrative interpretation of statistical results
  - Identifying key drivers of uncertainty
  - Tail risk articulation
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```python
def llm_guided_monte_carlo(variables, 
                          correlations, 
                          iterations=10000):
    """
    LLM-guided Monte Carlo simulation
    
    Parameters:
    variables - Key input variables with distributions
    correlations - Correlation matrix between variables
    iterations - Number of simulation runs
    
    Returns:
    Simulation results with narrative interpretation
    """
    # Generate correlated random variables
    simulations = generate_correlated_samples(
        variables, correlations, iterations)
    
    # Calculate output for each simulation
    results = [calculate_output(sim) for sim in simulations]
    
    # LLM interpretation of results
    interpretation = interpret_simulation(results)
    
    return results, interpretation

## Narrative Scenario Construction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- LLMs excel at creating coherent narratives
- Benefits of narrative scenarios:
  - Engaging for stakeholders
  - Easier to comprehend than pure numbers
  - Captures qualitative factors
  - Provides context for quantitative projections
  
- Process:
  1. Generate narrative skeleton
  2. Develop quantitative implications
  3. Ensure internal consistency
  4. Link to financial projections
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Example Scenario Narrative:**

*"By 2026, the electric vehicle market has reached a tipping point with 37% market share in major markets. Tesla has maintained leadership with 28% EV market share despite intensified competition from legacy automakers and new entrants. Their energy business has grown to represent 15% of revenue as grid-scale storage adoption accelerated following policy shifts in key markets. Manufacturing efficiency improvements have lifted gross margins to 27% despite pricing pressure in the mid-range segment..."*
