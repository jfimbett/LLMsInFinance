# Comparable Selection with LLMs

## The Comparable Company Challenge

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Cornerstone of relative valuation
- Traditional methods rely on:
  - Industry classification systems (GICS, SIC)
  - Analyst judgment
  - Size and growth filtering
  - Liquidity thresholds
- Key limitations:
  - Rigid classification systems
  - Missed cross-industry similarities
  - Superficial matching criteria
  - Time-consuming manual selection

## Beyond Industry Classifications

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Traditional industry grouping systems**:
  - GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard)
  - SIC (Standard Industrial Classification)
  - NAICS (North American Industry Classification System)
  - ICB (Industry Classification Benchmark)
  
- **Limitations**:
  - Rigid boundaries
  - Outdated categories
  - Missing emerging business models
  - Conglomerate classification challenges
  - Cross-industry similarities overlooked
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- **LLM enhancements**:
  - Nuanced business model understanding
  - Multi-dimensional similarity assessment
  - Cross-industry comparable identification
  - Evolving business model tracking
  - Novel peer group discovery

## Multidimensional Similarity Assessment

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Moving beyond single-dimension matching
- **Key similarity dimensions**:
  - Business model characteristics
  - Revenue drivers and patterns
  - Cost structure and margins
  - Growth profile and trajectory
  - Capital intensity
  - Risk factors and volatility
  - Return on capital profile
  - Competitive positioning

```
Identify the most comparable companies 
to Tesla (TSLA) based on a 
multidimensional analysis of:

1. Business model similarity
2. Growth characteristics
3. Margin profile
4. Capital intensity
5. Technology dependency
6. Brand premium
7. Vertical integration
8. Disruption potential

For each suggested comparable, explain 
the specific similarities and differences 
across these dimensions.
