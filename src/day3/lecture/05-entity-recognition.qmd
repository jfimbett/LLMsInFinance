# Entity Recognition in Large Texts

## The Financial Document Challenge

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Financial analysis requires processing extensive text
- Key document types:
  - Annual reports (10-K, Annual Report)
  - Quarterly filings (10-Q)
  - Earnings call transcripts
  - Proxy statements
  - Prospectuses and offering memoranda
  - Analyst reports
  - News and press releases
- Traditional challenges:
  - Volume (often 100+ pages)
  - Technical language
  - Structured and unstructured elements
  - Critical information dispersal

  - Extract contextual information about relationships
  - Quantify relationship strength

- **Network Construction**:
  - Build graph structure with entities as nodes
  - Relationships as edges with type and context
  - Enable network analysis and visualization
  - Support relationship-based queries
