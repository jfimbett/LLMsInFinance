Task: Assess Tesla's valuation relative to peers

[Analysis]: Valuation requires identifying 
appropriate comparables and analyzing 
relative multiples.

[Planning]: I will first identify Tesla's 
business segments, then find companies in 
each segment, calculate their multiples, 
and determine a blended valuation.

[Execution]: Searching Tesla's business 
segments... Found: electric vehicles, 
energy generation/storage, and automotive 
technology.

[Execution]: Identifying comparable companies... 
Found Rivian, Lucid, NIO, BYD for EVs; 
SunPower, Enphase for energy; Toyota, 
GM for automotive.

[Evaluation]: EV peers trade at higher 
multiples (15-20x) than traditional auto 
(8-10x), suggesting a blended approach.

[Adaptation]: Will weight segments by revenue 
contribution for more accurate valuation.
