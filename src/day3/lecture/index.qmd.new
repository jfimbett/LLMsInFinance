# Valuation Methods Recap

## Traditional Valuation Approaches

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Fundamental building blocks of financial analysis
- Two primary approaches:
  - Intrinsic valuation (DCF)
  - Relative valuation (multiples)
- Complementary methodologies
- Critical for investment decisions, M&A, and capital allocation

## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Core Principle**: Value = Present value of future cash flows
- **Key Components**:
  - Forecast period (typically 5-10 years)
  - Terminal value
  - Discount rate (WACC)
- **Advantages**:
  - Theoretically sound
  - Forward-looking
  - Captures long-term value creation
- **Challenges**:
  - Sensitivity to assumptions
  - Forecast accuracy
  - Terminal value dominance
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
$\text{Enterprise Value} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{FCF_t}{(1+WACC)^t} + \frac{TV}{(1+WACC)^n}$

$TV = \frac{FCF_{n+1}}{WACC - g}$

Where:
- $FCF_t$ = Free Cash Flow in year t

# Forecasting with LLMs

## Beyond Traditional Forecasting

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

  - Expert consensus
- LLMs offer complementary capabilities:
  - Text + numerical data integration
  - Contextual understanding
  - Pattern recognition across domains
  - Synthesizing diverse information sources

# Scenario Analysis with LLMs

## Beyond Base Case Forecasting

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Single forecasts fail to capture uncertainty
- Scenario analysis explores multiple potential futures
- Traditional approach:
  - Base, upside, downside cases
  - Limited by human imagination and resources
- LLMs enable:
  - Broader scenario generation
  - Systematic variation of inputs
  - Creative yet plausible alternative futures
  - Internally consistent scenario narratives

## LLM-Powered Scenario Framework: Part 1

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **1. Scenario Identification**:
  - Systematic exploration of key uncertainties
  - Critical variable identification
  - Coherent narrative development
- **2. Parameter Variation**:
  - Systematic variation of inputs
  - Correlation preservation
  - Cross-impact analysis

## LLM-Powered Scenario Framework: Part 2

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **3. Financial Modeling**:
  - Scenario-specific forecasts
  - Internally consistent projections
  - Financial statement integration
- **4. Valuation Impact**:
  - Probability-weighted outcomes
  - Sensitivity analysis
  - Risk factor quantification
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```
Scenario: Global Recession
Parameters:
- GDP Growth: -2.5%
- Interest Rates: +150bps
- Industry Revenue: -15%
- Margins: -300bps
- CapEx: -40%

Outcome:
- DCF Value: $32-38/share
- Probability: 25%
```

# Comparable Selection with LLMs

## The Comparable Company Challenge

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Cornerstone of relative valuation
- Traditional methods rely on:
  - Industry classification systems (GICS, SIC)
  - Analyst judgment
  - Size and growth filtering
  - Liquidity thresholds
- Key limitations:
  - Rigid classification systems
  - Missed cross-industry similarities
  - Superficial matching criteria
  - Time-consuming manual selection
:::

## Beyond Industry Classifications: Part 1

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Traditional industry grouping systems**:
  - GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard)
  - SIC (Standard Industrial Classification)
  - NAICS (North American Industry Classification System)
  - ICB (Industry Classification Benchmark)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

## Beyond Industry Classifications: Part 2

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Limitations of traditional systems**:
  - Rigid boundaries
  - Outdated categories
