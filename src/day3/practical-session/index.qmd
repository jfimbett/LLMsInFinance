# LLMs for Financial Valuation

## Overview

In this practical session, we will apply Large Language Models to various aspects of financial valuation, focusing on a case study of Tesla (TSLA). We'll explore how LLMs can enhance traditional valuation processes by:

1. Processing and analyzing large financial documents
2. Generating forward-looking financial projections
3. Selecting appropriate comparable companies
4. Creating comprehensive valuation analyses
5. Building agent-based systems for financial document analysis

## Session Structure

The practical session is divided into five main notebooks:

1. **Reading Large Financial Documents**: Techniques for efficiently processing annual reports, earnings transcripts, and other large financial texts using LLMs.

2. **Forecasting Cashflows with LLMs**: Using LLMs to generate financial projections while avoiding look-ahead bias and incorporating appropriate scenario analysis.

3. **Comparable Company Selection**: Leveraging LLMs to identify and analyze appropriate peer companies for relative valuation.

4. **Tesla Valuation Case Study**: Applying all the techniques learned to perform a comprehensive valuation of Tesla.

5. **Financial Filing Agents**: Building specialized AI agents that work together as a crew to analyze corporate filings and extract valuable insights.
