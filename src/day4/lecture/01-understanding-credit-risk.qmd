Example prompt for corporate credit analysis:

Analyze the credit risk profile of Company X
based on the following excerpt from their
recent 10-K filing and earnings call.
Focus on:
1. Cash flow generation capacity
2. Debt service ability
3. Refinancing risks
4. Management's risk mitigation strategies
5. Forward-looking statements about financial
   position

10-K excerpt: "The Company faced significant
headwinds in the third quarter, with operating
cash flow declining 15% year-over-year. Our
debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 3.5x from
2.8x last year. To address these challenges,
we've implemented a cost reduction program
expected to generate $50M in annual savings
and have secured an extension on our $200M
revolving credit facility to 2025..."

## Case Study: Consumer Loan Default Prediction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Traditional approach**:
  - Logistic regression on credit variables
  - Feature engineering from structured data
  - Threshold-based decision rules
  - Standardized application process
  
- **LLM-enhanced approach**:
  - Text analysis of loan purpose descriptions
  - Pattern detection in payment narratives
  - Context-aware feature extraction
  - Nuanced risk categorization
  
- **Performance comparison**:
  - 12% improvement in discrimination
  - 8% reduction in false positives
  - More granular risk stratification
  - Better handling of edge cases
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```
Loan purpose text samples:

1. "Need to consolidate my credit card
debt from 5 different cards with high
interest rates."

2. "Home renovation to increase property
value by adding a bathroom and upgrading
kitchen."

3. "Temporary cash flow issue due to job
transition. Starting new position with
higher salary next month."

4. "Unexpected medical expenses not covered
by insurance. Will repay from annual bonus
in December."

LLM analysis extracts repayment sources,
value creation potential, desperation
signals, and planning indicators from
these narratives.

## Case Study: Corporate Credit Rating Prediction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Traditional approach**:
  - Ratio-based statistical models
  - Industry-specific adjustments
  - Ordinal regression techniques
  - Structured interview processes
  
- **LLM-enhanced approach**:
  - Deep analysis of financial disclosures
  - Management communication assessment
  - Regulatory filing examination
  - Industry trend incorporation
  
- **Performance comparison**:
  - 15% improved rating accuracy
  - Earlier detection of deterioration
  - More consistent cross-sector analysis
  - Reduction in analyst time requirements
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```
Rating agency justification:
"The downgrade reflects our view that the
company's financial risk profile has weakened
due to aggressive debt-funded acquisitions,
resulting in adjusted leverage above 4.0x.
While management has articulated a deleveraging
plan, execution risks remain elevated given
the challenging operating environment and
integration complexities."

LLM can identify similar patterns in other
companies' disclosures before formal rating
actions, providing early warning signals.

## Model Calibration and Validation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Calibration challenges**:
  - Scarcity of default events
  - Economic cycle impacts
  - Portfolio concentration issues
  - Model drift over time
  
- **Validation approaches**:
  - Backtesting against actual defaults
  - Benchmarking against market signals
  - Out-of-time and out-of-sample testing
  - Stress testing and scenario analysis
  
- **LLM-specific considerations**:
  - Prompt engineering for consistency
  - Context length limitations
  - Fine-tuning requirements
  - Explainability mechanisms

# Simplified calibration example

# Historical default rates by model score decile
actual_defaults = [0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.2, 2.0, 
                  3.1, 4.5, 6.8, 10.5, 18.9]

# Model predicted probabilities
predicted_probs = [0.2, 0.5, 0.9, 1.5, 2.2, 
                  2.9, 4.0, 7.2, 9.8, 17.5]

# Calculate calibration metrics
brier_score = mean_squared_error(
    actual_defaults, predicted_probs)

# Apply calibration adjustment
calibrated_probs = isotonic_regression(
    predicted_probs, actual_defaults)
