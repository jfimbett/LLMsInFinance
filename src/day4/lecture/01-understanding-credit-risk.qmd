# Understanding Credit Risk

## Credit Risk Fundamentals

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Credit risk definition**:
  - Probability of default
  - Loss given default
  - Exposure at default
  
- **Traditional assessment methods**:
  - Credit scoring models
  - Rating agency methodologies
  - Financial ratio analysis
  - Market-based approaches
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- **Three pillars of credit risk**:
  - **Probability of Default (PD)**: Likelihood borrower fails to meet obligations

  - **Exposure at Default (EAD)**: Outstanding amount when default happens

- **Expected Loss Formula**:
  - EL = PD × LGD × EAD
  - This forms basis of all credit pricing

  - Information overload and cognitive limits
  - Inconsistent judgment across time/mood
  - Limited memory of historical patterns
  - Language barriers and cultural nuances
  
  **LLMs excel at**:

Example prompt for corporate credit analysis:

Analyze the credit risk profile of Company X
based on the following excerpt from their
recent 10-K filing and earnings call.
Focus on:
1. Cash flow generation capacity
2. Debt service ability
3. Refinancing risks
4. Management's risk mitigation strategies
5. Forward-looking statements about financial
   position

10-K excerpt: "The Company faced significant
headwinds in the third quarter, with operating
cash flow declining 15% year-over-year. Our
debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 3.5x from
2.8x last year. To address these challenges,
we've implemented a cost reduction program
expected to generate $50M in annual savings
and have secured an extension on our $200M
revolving credit facility to 2025..."

## Case Study: Consumer Loan Default Prediction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Traditional approach**:
  - Logistic regression on credit variables
  - Feature engineering from structured data
  - Threshold-based decision rules
  - Standardized application process
  
- **LLM-enhanced approach**:
  - Text analysis of loan purpose descriptions
  - Pattern detection in payment narratives
  - Context-aware feature extraction
  - Nuanced risk categorization
  
- **Performance comparison**:
  - 12% improvement in discrimination
  - 8% reduction in false positives
  - More granular risk stratification
  - Better handling of edge cases
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```
Loan purpose text samples:

1. "Need to consolidate my credit card
debt from 5 different cards with high
interest rates."

2. "Home renovation to increase property
value by adding a bathroom and upgrading
kitchen."

3. "Temporary cash flow issue due to job
transition. Starting new position with
higher salary next month."

4. "Unexpected medical expenses not covered
by insurance. Will repay from annual bonus
in December."

LLM analysis extracts repayment sources,
value creation potential, desperation
signals, and planning indicators from
these narratives.

## Case Study: Corporate Credit Rating Prediction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Traditional approach**:
  - Ratio-based statistical models
  - Industry-specific adjustments
  - Ordinal regression techniques
  - Structured interview processes
  
- **LLM-enhanced approach**:
  - Deep analysis of financial disclosures
  - Management communication assessment
  - Regulatory filing examination
  - Industry trend incorporation
  
- **Performance comparison**:
  - 15% improved rating accuracy
  - Earlier detection of deterioration
  - More consistent cross-sector analysis
  - Reduction in analyst time requirements
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```
Rating agency justification:
"The downgrade reflects our view that the
company's financial risk profile has weakened
due to aggressive debt-funded acquisitions,
resulting in adjusted leverage above 4.0x.
While management has articulated a deleveraging
plan, execution risks remain elevated given
the challenging operating environment and
integration complexities."

LLM can identify similar patterns in other
companies' disclosures before formal rating
actions, providing early warning signals.

## Real-World LLM Credit Risk Advantages

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Early warning detection**:
  - LLMs spot deteriorating credit quality 6-12 months before rating agencies
  - Example: Management language shifts from "confident" to "cautious" to "challenging"
  - Traditional models miss these subtle linguistic patterns
  
- **Hidden risk discovery**:
  - Buried risk factors in 400-page 10-K filings
  - Supplier concentration risks mentioned only once
  - Customer dependency patterns across subsidiaries
  - Legal proceeding severity assessment
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- **Concrete performance gains**:
  
  **JP Morgan's experience**:
  - 20% reduction in credit losses using LLM-enhanced models
  - 40% faster loan processing times
  - 85% accuracy in predicting rating downgrades
  
  **What LLMs caught that humans missed**:
  - Enron: Unusual language in risk disclosures
  - Lehman: Repo accounting description changes
  - WeWork: Management tone inconsistencies
  - FTX: Vague liquidity explanations
:::

## The Information Advantage

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Information asymmetry reduction**:
  - Traditional credit analysis: 5-10% of available information used
  - LLM analysis: 80-90% of public information processed
  - Unstructured data represents 80% of corporate information
  
- **Speed and scale advantages**:
  - Human analyst: 5-10 companies per week deep analysis
  - LLM system: 1000+ companies per hour analysis
  - Real-time monitoring vs. quarterly updates
  - Cross-industry pattern recognition at scale
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- **Information sources LLMs can process**:
  - SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, proxy statements)
  - Earnings call transcripts and management presentations
  - News articles and press releases (thousands daily)
  - Industry reports and analyst research
  - Social media sentiment and executive communications
  - Patent filings and litigation documents
  - Supply chain and customer relationship data
  
- **Human impossibility**: No human team can process this volume consistently

## Why LLMs Beat Traditional Models: Concrete Examples

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%}
- **Example 1: Hertz Bankruptcy Prediction (2020)**:
  - Traditional models: Showed improving ratios until 1 month before bankruptcy
  - LLM analysis: Detected management desperation language 6 months earlier
  - Key signal: Shift from "confident" to "flexible" to "exploring all options"
  
- **Example 2: SVB Risk Detection (2023)**:
  - Traditional metrics: Strong capital ratios, profitable operations
  - LLM warning signs: Increasing deposit concentration anxiety in earnings calls
  - Language pattern: "Diversifying" mentioned 15x more in final calls
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- **Example 3: Evergrande Warning Signals (2019-2021)**:
  - Traditional approach: Strong growth, meeting covenants
  - LLM detected: Subtle changes in land acquisition descriptions
  - Pattern recognition: "Strategic" land sales vs. "opportunistic" sales
  
- **The LLM advantage is clear**:
  - Humans process 2-3 companies per day thoroughly
  - LLMs process 2,000+ companies per day
  - Humans miss linguistic subtleties under time pressure
  - LLMs consistently apply pattern recognition at scale
