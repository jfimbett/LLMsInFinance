    "## 9. Best Practices for Structured Generation in Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our exploration, here are key best practices for implementing structured generation in financial applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schema Design:\n",
    "- **Start Simple**: Begin with a minimal schema and expand as needed\n",
    "- **Use Nested Structures**: Organize related information hierarchically\n",
    "- **Include Validation Rules**: Define constraints to ensure data quality\n",
    "- **Document Fields Clearly**: Provide clear descriptions for each field\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Engineering:\n",
    "- **Be Explicit**: Clearly state the format requirements in your prompts\n",
    "- **Provide Examples**: Include sample outputs to guide the model\n",
    "- **Use Temperature Control**: Lower temperature (0-0.3) for more deterministic outputs\n",
    "- **Use System Messages**: Set the context with system messages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling:\n",
    "- **Validate Outputs**: Always validate generated structures against your schema\n",
    "- **Implement Fallbacks**: Have mechanisms to handle parsing failures\n",
    "- **Consider Multiple Passes**: Use iterative refinement for complex extractions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implementation:\n",
    "- **Use Function Calling**: Leverage OpenAI's function calling for complex schemas\n",
    "- **Batch Related Extractions**: Process similar documents together\n",
    "- **Consider Trade-offs**: Balance between structure complexity and extraction reliability\n",
    "- **Build Evaluation Metrics**: Track accuracy and completeness of extractions"
