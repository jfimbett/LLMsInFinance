# Finance Fundamentals: Valuations Demystified

## Introduction

Welcome to "Finance Fundamentals: Valuations Demystified" - your friendly guide to understanding the core concepts of business valuation. Whether you're new to finance or looking for a refresher, this guide will equip you with the essential knowledge needed for our LLMs in Finance course.

## 1. The Foundations: Financial Statements

Before diving into valuation methods, let's establish a solid understanding of the three primary financial statements:

### Income Statement: The Profit Journey

The income statement shows a company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period:

```
Revenue (or Sales)
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
= Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses (SG&A, R&D, etc.)
= Operating Income (EBIT)
- Interest Expense
= Pre-tax Income
- Taxes
= Net Income
```

**Key metrics:**
- **Gross Margin** = Gross Profit / Revenue
- **Operating Margin** = Operating Income / Revenue
- **Net Profit Margin** = Net Income / Revenue

### Balance Sheet: The Financial Snapshot

The balance sheet provides a snapshot of what a company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and shareholder equity at a specific point in time:

```
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity
```

**Key components:**
- **Assets**: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Property & Equipment, Intangible Assets
- **Liabilities**: Accounts Payable, Debt (Short-term and Long-term)
- **Shareholders' Equity**: Common Stock, Retained Earnings

### Cash Flow Statement: Following the Money

The cash flow statement tracks the inflows and outflows of cash across three categories:

1. **Operating Activities**: Cash generated from core business operations
2. **Investing Activities**: Cash used for long-term asset investments
3. **Financing Activities**: Cash from investors and creditors, and payments to shareholders

**Key insight**: A company can be profitable on paper (income statement) but still face cash flow problems!

## 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

DCF is the gold standard of valuation methods, based on the principle that a business's value is the sum of all its future cash flows, discounted to present value.

### The DCF Formula

The formula for calculating the present value of future cash flows is:

$$PV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{TV}{(1+r)^n}$$

Where:
- $PV$ = Present Value
- $CF_t$ = Cash Flow in period t
- $r$ = Discount Rate (often WACC)
- $TV$ = Terminal Value
- $n$ = Forecast Period

### Step 1: Forecast Free Cash Flows (FCF)

Free Cash Flow represents the cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures:

$$FCF = EBIT \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate}) + \text{Depreciation} - \text{Capital Expenditures} - \Delta \text{Working Capital}$$

Typically, we forecast detailed cash flows for 5-10 years.

### Step 2: Calculate Terminal Value

Terminal value represents all cash flows beyond the forecast period, calculated using either:

**Perpetuity Growth Method:**
$$TV = \frac{FCF_{n+1}}{r - g}$$

Where $g$ is the perpetual growth rate (often 2-3%)

**Exit Multiple Method:**
$$TV = FCF_n \times \text{Terminal Multiple}$$

Where the Terminal Multiple is often based on EV/EBITDA.

### Step 3: Discount to Present Value

Calculate the present value of projected cash flows using an appropriate discount rate, typically the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):

$$WACC = E/(D+E) \times R_e + D/(D+E) \times R_d \times (1 - T)$$

Where:
- $E$ = Market value of equity
- $D$ = Market value of debt
- $R_e$ = Cost of equity (often calculated using CAPM)
- $R_d$ = Cost of debt
- $T$ = Tax rate

### Step 4: Calculate Enterprise Value and Equity Value

$$\text{Enterprise Value (EV)} = \sum \text{PV of FCFs} + \text{PV of Terminal Value}$$

$$\text{Equity Value} = \text{Enterprise Value} - \text{Net Debt} + \text{Non-operating Assets}$$

$$\text{Share Price} = \text{Equity Value} / \text{Shares Outstanding}$$

### Example: Simple DCF Calculation

Let's walk through a simplified example:

Assumptions:
- Year 1 FCF: $100 million
- Growth rate: 5% for years 2-5, then 2% terminal growth
- Discount rate (WACC): 10%
- Shares outstanding: 50 million

FCF Projections:
- Year 1: $100 million
- Year 2: $105 million
- Year 3: $110.25 million
- Year 4: $115.76 million
- Year 5: $121.55 million

Terminal value:
$$TV = \frac{121.55 \times (1 + 0.02)}{0.10 - 0.02} = \frac{124}{0.08} = $1,550 \text{ million}$$

Present values (in $millions):
- Year 1: $100 / 1.1 = $90.91$
- Year 2: $105 / 1.1^2 = $86.78$
- Year 3: $110.25 / 1.1^3 = $82.82$
- Year 4: $115.76 / 1.1^4 = $79.02$
- Year 5: $121.55 / 1.1^5 = $75.47$
- Terminal value: $1,550 / 1.1^5 = $962.14$

Enterprise Value: $90.91 + $86.78 + $82.82 + $79.02 + $75.47 + $962.14 = $1,377.14 million

If net debt is $177.14 million, then:
Equity Value = $1,377.14 - $177.14 = $1,200 million

Share price = $1,200 million / 50 million shares = $24 per share

## 3. Multiple Valuation Methods

Multiple-based valuation compares a company to similar companies using standardized valuation ratios.

### Common Valuation Multiples

#### Enterprise Value (EV) Multiples
- **EV/EBITDA**: Enterprise Value / Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization
  - Typical ranges: 5-8x (mature), 8-12x (growing), 12x+ (high growth)
- **EV/Revenue**: Enterprise Value / Revenue
  - Useful for pre-profit companies
  - Typical ranges: 1-3x (mature), 3-6x (growing), 6x+ (high growth)
- **EV/EBIT**: Enterprise Value / Earnings Before Interest & Taxes

#### Equity Multiples
- **P/E Ratio**: Price per Share / Earnings per Share
  - Typical ranges: 10-15x (value), 15-25x (growth), 25x+ (high growth)
- **P/B Ratio**: Price per Share / Book Value per Share
  - Useful for financial institutions
- **P/S Ratio**: Price per Share / Sales per Share

### Example: Valuing a Company Using Multiples

For a company with:
- EBITDA of $50 million
- Net income of $25 million
- 10 million shares outstanding

If comparable companies trade at:
- EV/EBITDA of 8x
- P/E of 15x

Then:
- EV = $50 million × 8 = $400 million
- If net debt is $100 million, Equity Value = $400 million - $100 million = $300 million
- Share price = $300 million / 10 million shares = $30 per share

OR:
- Share price = $25 million × 15 / 10 million shares = $37.5 per share

The difference between the two methods indicates potential mispricing or different growth expectations.

## 4. Key Accounting Concepts for Valuation

### Accrual vs. Cash Accounting

- **Accrual Accounting**: Recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred
- **Cash Accounting**: Recognizes revenue and expenses only when cash changes hands

Financial statements use accrual accounting, but cash flow is what matters for valuation!

### EBITDA vs. Net Income

- **EBITDA**: Operating performance before capital structure, tax strategies, and capex decisions
- **Net Income**: Bottom-line profit after all expenses, taxes, and accounting adjustments

EBITDA is often preferred for valuation as it's more comparable across companies with different capital structures.

### Working Capital

Working capital represents the operational liquidity of a business:

$$\text{Working Capital} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}$$

Changes in working capital impact free cash flow:
- Increasing working capital requirements = Cash outflow
- Decreasing working capital requirements = Cash inflow

## 5. Advanced Concepts

### Adjusting for Non-Recurring Items

When valuing a company, it's important to adjust for one-time or unusual items:
- Restructuring charges
- Litigation settlements
- Asset impairments
- Gains/losses from asset sales

These should be excluded when forecasting future performance.

### Growth vs. Value

Two fundamental approaches to valuation:
- **Growth investing**: Focuses on future potential, often using revenue multiples or DCF with aggressive growth assumptions
- **Value investing**: Focuses on current fundamentals and looks for discrepancies between market price and intrinsic value

### The Role of Industry-Specific Metrics

Different industries may have unique valuation metrics:
- **SaaS**: Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV)
- **Retail**: Same-store sales, sales per square foot
- **Banking**: Net Interest Margin, Loan-to-Deposit Ratio
- **Insurance**: Combined Ratio, Loss Ratio

## 6. How LLMs Are Changing Valuation

As we transition into the main course material, consider these ways LLMs are impacting financial analysis:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Extracting market sentiment from news, social media, and earnings calls
2. **Financial Statement Analysis**: Automating the extraction and analysis of financial data
3. **Comparable Company Selection**: Identifying truly comparable companies based on business models
4. **Forecast Generation**: Creating and stress-testing financial projections
5. **Valuation Report Writing**: Generating comprehensive valuation reports with key insights

## Conclusion

This guide has covered the fundamental concepts of business valuation that will serve as a foundation for our exploration of LLMs in finance. Remember that valuation is both an art and a science—financial models provide a framework, but judgment and context remain critically important.
